// Initially this condition can be used to create a lock as it returns 1 which can be a bool, once the lock is made, 
// this can be set to for example 122 (no longer a boolish repsponse, and the locks withdraw function will fail as
// premature unlock conditions need to be checked first in order to get a withdrawable amount from a lock.
// for this reason premature unlocking conditions can be revoked.
